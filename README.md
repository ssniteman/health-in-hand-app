Startup Weekend - Spartanburg SC

As a student of the Iron Yard Academy 2014 Q1, Shane Sniteman and myself worked with a local startup Health in Hands Juice and Smoothy Bar. Over a weekend Shane and I put together ideas for Emily Elise and her startup in Downtown Spartanburg. https://www.facebook.com/HealthInHandSpartanburg
